### Collaborators
The only person but myself who has access to modify this project without having to make pull requests, is RyanTheAlmighty, I have given him collaborator permission if in the unlikely case he wishes to fix or amend something in the code.

### Things to Note
I am sorry if you find this poorly-coded, however on my behalf I last did PHP 4 years ago, for a short period of time, as of now I am teaching myself PHP (like I do all programming languages).
